My mobile app Weight a Minute was made to help users track their daily weight, set goals, and stay motivated in a simple way. It was designed for people who want to follow their fitness progress without using complicated apps. The app lets users log their weight, set a goal weight and date, and get a text message when they reach that goal. It focuses on being easy to use, private, and encouraging. The app has three main screens. The first is the Login screen where users can log in or create an account. The second is the Goal screen where users can enter their target weight, choose a date, and select the weight unit they use. The third is the Daily Weights screen where users can add, edit, or delete entries in a list. Each screen is simple and easy to understand. The text is large and centered, and the buttons have rounded edges to make the app friendly and clean. These designs make it easy for users to move through the app and focus on their goals. I tested the app often using the Android Studio emulator. I tested each feature like logging in, saving goals, adding weights, deleting entries, and sending messages. Testing was very important because it showed me where small problems were happening. It also helped make sure everything worked the way a user would expect it to. There were a few challenges while making this app. One was getting the list of weights to update correctly when users added new entries. Another was getting the date picker and weight unit dropdown to show the right information. I also worked on making sure the app looked good on different screens. Solving these problems helped me get better at finding and fixing errors and made the app stronger overall. The part I am most proud of is the Goal screen. It shows everything I learned in this course. It connects to the database, lets users choose a goal and date, and has the option to send a message when a goal is reached. It is simple, organized, and easy to use. I believe this screen shows that I understand both the design and coding sides of mobile app development.
